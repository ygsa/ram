## Logon information {#section_gf3_vhf_xdb .section}

RAM user logon requires an enterprise alias, a sub-user name, and a password.

The enterprise alias is the one you have configured in [Ram initial setup](intl.en-US/Quick Start/Ram initial setup.md). If you have not configured the enterprise alias, the default enterprise alias is your cloud account ID \(which can be queried through**Account Management** \> **Security Settings**.
