# Group {#concept_hb3_nsf_xdb .concept}

If you have created multiple RAM users with your Alibaba Cloud account, we recommend that you manage those users by group to simplify the management process. Classify RAM users with the same responsibility by group and [Authorization](intl.en-US/User Guide/Authorization/Authorization.md) upon authorization. The benefits of doing so are as follows:

-   When the responsibility of a specific user changes, you can simply move them to an appropriate group, which does not have an impact on other users.
-   When the permissions of a group change, you only need to modify the authorization policy for the group, which can be applied to all users.
